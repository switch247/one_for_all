# Flask Modern Folder Structure Python CRUD Template

This is a Flask template for building large-scale projects with a modern folder structure and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. It provides a solid foundation for developing web applications with Flask.

## Features

- Modern folder structure for better organization and scalability
- CRUD functionality for managing data
- Flask-SQLAlchemy for interacting with the database
- Flask-WTF for handling forms and validation
- Flask-Login for user authentication and session management
- Flask-Migrate for database migrations
- Flask-Bcrypt for password hashing
- Flask-RESTful for building RESTful APIs
- Flask-CORS for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- Flask-Testing for unit testing
- Bootstrap for responsive and mobile-first design
- Jinja2 templating engine for dynamic HTML rendering

## Folder Structure

The template follows a modular structure to keep the codebase organized and maintainable. Here's an overview of the main folders and their purposes:

- `app`: Contains the core application code
  - `models`: Defines the database models using Flask-SQLAlchemy
  - `views`: Implements the routes and views for handling HTTP requests
  - `forms`: Contains the form classes for user input validation
  - `templates`: Stores the HTML templates for rendering dynamic content
  - `static`: Holds static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images
- `migrations`: Manages database migrations using Flask-Migrate
- `tests`: Contains unit tests for the application
- `config.py`: Stores configuration variables for the application
- `run.py`: Entry point for running the application

## Getting Started

To use this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the application settings in `config.py`
4. Create the database: `flask db init && flask db migrate && flask db upgrade`
5. Run the application: `python run.py`

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`. The template provides a basic user interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. You can customize and extend the functionality according to your project requirements.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, use the following command: `python -m unittest discover -s tests`
